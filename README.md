# File_Organiser
This project is a global command line application made using Node.js and JavaScript. 
It organizes all your files from a particular folder into different sections so that you need not do it manually.
There are three commands : Organise, Tree, and Help.
The organise command will take path of a directory/folder as input, and after executing the command, you will find a separate folder in the same 
directory named "Organised_folder" which contains all the files arranged in different sections, such as apps, media, documents, archives, pictures,and others.
There is another command named "Tree" which will arrange all the files and folders inside the given directory (which is taken as input) in the form of a tree.
The "help" command tells the user about the various commands present.
